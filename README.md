# Developing self assessment processes

Making statements more measurable
Providing instant feedback and support
Gamifying learning

As yet unnamed and experimental project to review and extend my learning in NextJS.
Plus adding in new learning from using llm via api

## Current status

Very messy UIs resulting from experiments
Main working pages are _landing page_ which can show a score bar, _Test yourself_ which provides criteria to choose, and _dynamic question pages_ which allow inputting responses to criteria and give feedback from ai, including points/marks and resources to study
